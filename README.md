# LynxOS
A discord bot created by MonocleHat, LynxOS runs off python and is slowly being worked on. 


# Features!
Implemented
- Bot responds to user commands with various quotes
- Utilized youtube-dl integration to play music in server
- management tools make modifying bot code easier - as users can submit restart commands to reboot the bot on the fly

To be Implemented!
- I'm presently attempting to recreate Bash.org like functionality by storing user quotes in a database and queueing them up when requested by a user. 
- Currently I'm learning how sqlalchemy works before this is fully implemented.
